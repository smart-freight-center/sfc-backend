<!-- A software bug is an error, flaw or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. (Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) -->

<!-- Most of the following comments are taken by the article
"How to Write a Good Bug Report? Tips and Tricks",  https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/how-to-write-good-bug-report/ -->

**Describe the bug**

<!-- Bug description helps the developer to understand the bug. It describes the problem encountered. The poor description will create confusion and waste the time of the developers and the testers as well. -->

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Steps To Reproduce**

<!-- A good Bug report should clearly mention the steps to reproduce. The steps should include actions that cause the bug. Donâ€™t make generic statements. Be specific in the steps to follow. -->

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'

<!-- A Bug description is incomplete without the Expected and Actual results. It is necessary to outline what is the outcome of the test and what the user should expect. The reader should know what the correct outcome of the test is. Clearly, mention what happened during the test and what was the outcome. -->

**Expected behavior**

A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Actual behavior**
